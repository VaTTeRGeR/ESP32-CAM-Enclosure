# ESP32-CAM-Enclosure
Compact enclosure for the ubiquitous ESP32-CAM with the USB-Serial board and an external antenna. The program- and reset-button are still accessible through the cooling slits.

# Printing Guide
Use the combined *.stl file for easy printing. Print time is 3 hours with average printing speeds and 100% infill. Support should not be necessary if your cooling is sufficient.

# Assembly
1. Insert the Camera into the front piece, guiding the antenna cable through the small gap on the side of the enclosure.
2. Screw the SMA-Connector to the bottom piece and wind the excess antenna cable into a loop.
3. Test fit the two halves, then glue together with super glue once everything fits. The two halves are self aligning.
4. Melt the threaded inserts into their holes in the back if you need mounting points. The holes are sized for the cheap M3-5x5mm threaded inserts.
